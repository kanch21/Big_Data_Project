## Predicting Flight Delays

This project is part of Big Data project. <br>
We have implemented several machine learning models like K-Means, Logistic regression, Gradient Boosted tree model, Naive Bayes model and Linear Regression model to predict flight delays. All the models have been implemented using Pyspark on databricks.

Through this project, we shall be: <br>
1.) Visualizing various kinds of delays with respect to time and airports<br>
2.) Determining similar clusters of delays and distance <br>
3.) Predicting delays less than or more than the average delay time <br>
4.) Predicting elapsed time of flights due to delays <br>
